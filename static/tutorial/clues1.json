  "4": {
    "clue": "If Tina spends 12 hours per week on this project, she will need to receive overtime pay.",
    "explanation": "All employees receive 1.5X their normal pay for any overtime work. Since funding for the project is very limited, overtime work is likely to cause you to go over budget."
  },
  "5": {
    "clue": "The person who works from Seattle cannot work 4 hours per week.",
    "explanation": "Due to corporate policies, each office must meet a certain number of project hours per week. The Seattle office needs more than 4 hours to meet the company’s minimum requirements."

    "clue": "The person who works from Los Angeles should be assigned more project hours than the Database Administrator.",
    "explanation": "Although the Los Angeles office is close to their maximum weekly number of hours, it is ideal that their hours be as close to the upper limit as possible (so that profit can be maximized without incurring overtime pay).
